Monopoly-Board-game-simulation

The Monopoly Board is effectively a circle with 40 spaces on which a player can land. Players move from space to space around the board in a circle (square).
The number of spaces a player moves is determined by the roll of 2 dice. Most often, the player will roll the dice, move the number of spaces shown on the dice, land on a space, and end their turn there. If this were the entire game, there would be an equal probability of landing on all 40 spaces after many turns - and the distribution of space frequency would be uniform.

Implement the rules of the Monopoly movement.
Used R6 to create an object class Player which will be used to keep track of a player.
